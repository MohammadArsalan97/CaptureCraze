# CaptureCraze
This is a simple iOS app developed using SwiftUI that allows users to upload videos and fetches all uploaded videos into a list. It integrates with a video backend API as the backend for storing and retrieving videos.

# Features

- Video Uploading: Users can make a video from their device's camera and upload it to the backend API.
- Videos Fetching: The app fetches all uploaded videos from the backend API and displays them in a list.
- Video Details: Tapping on a video in the list shows its details, such as the video title, duration, and thumbnail.

# Findings and Observations

During the completion of the assessment, I observed the following findings:

- Integration with GitHub: The app integrates api.video for storing and retrieving videos. This approach leverages the capabilities of api.video for video storage and provides a reliable and accessible solution.
- SwiftUI Usage: The app is developed using SwiftUI, which allows for a declarative and efficient approach to building the user interface. SwiftUI simplifies UI development and enables a smooth and intuitive user experience.
- Video Upload and Fetch: The app allows users to select videos from their device's camera and upload them to the api.video. It also fetches the uploaded videos from api.video and displays them in a scrollable list. This functionality provides a seamless workflow for managing and viewing uploaded videos.
